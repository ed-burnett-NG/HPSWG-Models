## Field reference

This table lists the fields defined for data entry or display, derived from `//field` and `//field-via` directives in the model. See the [forms folder](../../forms/field-tables.md) for the aggregated cross-model view.

[`models/annotation_image`](../models/annotation_image/) | [v0.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ed-burnett-NG/HPSWG-Models/refs/heads/main/models/annotation_image/annotation_image_v0.1.tsv) | [Open in Modeller](https://research.nationalgallery.org.uk/lab/modelling/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ed-burnett-NG/HPSWG-Models/refs/heads/main/models/annotation_image/annotation_image_v0.1.tsv)

This model records a digital image used as an annotation base. It captures identification, image metadata, capture provenance, rights, annotation group classification, and links to the heritage object depicted. The image may also be linked optionally to a dataset record where it forms part of a formal analytical output. Annotation of the image itself -- the spatial recording of sample sites, areas of interest, and examination positions -- is handled in the annotation_image workflow and related models, not here.

_A digital image designated for use as an annotation base within a heritage science documentation system. Annotation images provide the visual reference against which sample sites, areas of interest, condition features, and local examination and analysis events are spatially documented. The same image may serve multiple annotation purposes simultaneously. Images are uploaded independently and associated with one or more annotation group types. A link to a dataset record is optional where the image also forms part of a formal analytical output._

| Required | Human understandable Label | Alternative Labels | CRM Code | Behaviour | Label Description |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| ✓ | Image Label | Image Code | E41 | ![behaviour: Free Text](https://img.shields.io/badge/%2F%2F-Free%20Text-0969da) | A human-readable name or code used to identify this image within documentation or reporting systems. |
| Optional | Image File Name | -- | E41 | -- | The original file name of the digital image file. Note: ResearchSpace may require a system-specific property for this value -- to be confirmed during implementation. (Note: may require a system-specific property in ResearchSpace. behaviour:free-text) |
| Optional | IIIF URL | Source URL | E42 | -- | The source IIIF URL for this image. Where ResearchSpace is used for annotation, images must be ingested into the system and an internal reference will also be assigned. Note: the IIIF URL could alternatively be modelled as a link to an E31 document (IIIF info.json or manifest) -- this remains an open design question to be resolved during implementation. (IIIF source URL for this image. May alternatively be modelled as a link to an E31 document (info.json or IIIF manifest) -- open design question. behaviour:url) |
