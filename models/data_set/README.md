# Data set

![Status: Formed](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-formed-brightgreen)

This folder contains versioned model files for use with the [National Gallery Dynamic Modeller](https://research.nationalgallery.org.uk/lab/modelling/). Models are expressed as tab-separated triples aligned to CIDOC CRM and related extension ontologies.

## Ontologies

## Field reference

This table lists the fields defined for data entry or display, derived from `//field` and `//field-via` directives in the model. See the [forms folder](../../forms/field-tables.md) for the aggregated cross-model view.

[`models/data_set`](../models/data_set/) | [v0.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ed-burnett-NG/HPSWG-Models/refs/heads/main/models/data_set/data_set_v0.1.tsv) | [Open in Modeller](https://research.nationalgallery.org.uk/lab/modelling/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ed-burnett-NG/HPSWG-Models/refs/heads/main/models/data_set/data_set_v0.1.tsv)

This model records a digital dataset produced by a heritage science observation event. It captures identification, description, dataset typing, rights and access conditions, version information, and links to constituent file records or file groups. Links back to the generating observation event and optionally to a method or protocol document. Raw-to-processed dataset relationships are not modelled here; these will be handled by a future data_processing event model or resolved at the digital_file level.

_A digital dataset produced as the output of a scientific or technical observation event. Covers the full range of digital outputs in heritage science including images, spectra, elemental maps, numerical datasets, and documentary records. May incorporate individual file records or grouped collections of files. Versioning is supported via a version number and links to related dataset versions._
